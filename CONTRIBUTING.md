# Contributing to Mindful Mana

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Mindful Mana!  
This project aims to provide a simple, calming daily meditation experience built with React and Node.js.  
Whether you’re fixing bugs, improving the UI, or adding features, your help is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Started

2. **Clone** your fork:

## Guidelines

- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix.  
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g. `fix: adjust button color on home page`).  
- Follow existing code style and formatting conventions.  
- Add comments for complex logic or new components.  
- Open an issue for discussion before large feature changes.

 ## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have an idea for improvement?  
Open a [GitHub issue](../../issues) and describe:
- What’s happening vs. what you expected.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Your environment (browser, OS, etc.).

Be kind and specific — it helps everyone. 😊
